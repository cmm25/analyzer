# Solidity Analyzer

Solidity Analyzer is a static analysis tool designed to assist developers in identifying security vulnerabilities and best practice violations in Solidity smart contracts. It parses Solidity source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST) and performs various analyses to discover potential issues in the code.

## Project Overview

Solidity Analyzer focuses on improving smart contract security and efficiency by detecting common issues such as reentrancy vulnerabilities, unchecked external call returns, and gas optimization opportunities. By integrating this tool early in the development cycle, teams can reduce risks and enhance code quality.

## Key Features

- **Security Vulnerability Detection:**  
  Analyze code for patterns that may lead to reentrancy attacks, unsafe external calls, and other security concerns.
  
- **Best Practices Analysis:**  
  Assess coding standards and suggest improvements for state variable management, function visibility, and mutability.

- **Gas Optimization Analysis:**  
  Identify inefficiencies in contract code that may lead to excessive gas consumption and recommend optimizations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solidity-analyzer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd solidity-analyzer
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage

Solidity Analyzer can be executed via the command line. It supports analysis of single or multiple contract files and can generate reports suitable for CI/CD integration.

To run an analysis, execute the following command from the project folder:
```
solidity-analyzer analyze <path-to-contracts>
```

For further customization (for example, to generate an HTML report or filter issues by severity), refer to the documentation in the projectâ€™s source code.

## Integration

Solidity Analyzer can be seamlessly integrated into development workflows, including CI/CD pipelines, to automatically scan new or modified smart contracts. This proactive approach helps maintain secure and efficient codebases.
